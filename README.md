# profit_margin
Calculates profit margins for all items in old school runescape

# Implementation

This is a python script for the time being so you'll have to have python downloaded AND added to you path to run this script. I personally use python3.
The download for python is here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Note, when installing python if there are any boxes to check or options regarding adding python to your path add it. Also the same thing applies with pip.

To run the script, when it is downloaded you can either double click on it (run as python exe or run with python launcher(mac)) or you open up your terminal and navigate to the directory it is in and type in "python margin_xxx.py".
